# Go To Wiktionary

This is a Firefox add on which adds a menu item to the context menu if text has been selected by the user. The menu item is labelled with the selected text and the word "Wiktionary". Clicking on it takes the page to the Witkionary entry for the selected text for translating the word from **Spanish to English**.

Currently it is up to the user to make sure only one word or possibly a short phrase (if it is thought likely that Witktionary would have a translation for the phrase) is selected. Otherwise Wiktionary will not have a page for the selected text.

The user should use the browser's back button to return the article they were reading.

It is hoped that this add on will be improved and also extended to cover all the languages in Wiktionary.
